${1:# allocation_pool_end: From the subnet pool the last IP that should be assigned to the virtual machines. 
# allocation_pool_start: From the subnet pool the starting address from which the IP should be allocated. 
# api_timeout: How long should the socket layer wait before timing out for API calls. If this is omitted, nothing will 
# auth: Dictionary containing auth information as needed by the cloud's auth plugin strategy. For the default 
# auth_type: Name of the auth plugin to use. If the cloud uses something other than password authentication, the name 
# availability_zone: Ignored. Present for backwards compatibility 
# cacert: A path to a CA Cert bundle that can be used as part of verifying SSL API requests. 
# cert: A path to a client certificate to use as part of the SSL transaction. 
# cidr: The CIDR representation of the subnet that should be assigned to the subnet. Required when `state' is 
# cloud: Named cloud to operate against. Provides default values for `auth' and `auth_type'. This parameter is 
# dns_nameservers: List of DNS nameservers for this subnet. 
# enable_dhcp: Whether DHCP should be enabled for this subnet. 
# endpoint_type: Endpoint URL type to fetch from the service catalog. 
# gateway_ip: The ip that would be assigned to the gateway for this subnet 
# host_routes: A list of host route dictionaries for the subnet. 
# ip_version: The IP version of the subnet 4 or 6 
# ipv6_address_mode: IPv6 address mode 
# ipv6_ra_mode: IPv6 router advertisement mode 
# key: A path to a client key to use as part of the SSL transaction. 
# name: (required) The name of the subnet that should be created. Although Neutron allows for non-unique subnet 
# network_name: Name of the network to which the subnet should be attached Required when `state' is 'present' 
# no_gateway_ip: The gateway IP would not be assigned for this subnet 
# project: Project name or ID containing the subnet (name admin-only) 
# region_name: Name of the region. 
# state: Indicate desired state of the resource 
# timeout: How long should ansible wait for the requested resource. 
# use_default_subnetpool: Use the default subnetpool for `ip_version' to obtain a CIDR. 
# validate_certs: Whether or not SSL API requests should be verified. Before 2.3 this defaulted to True. 
# wait: Should ansible wait until the requested resource is complete.
